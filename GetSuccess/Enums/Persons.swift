    case stevejobs = "Steve Jobs.\n\nThe name is so incredibly inspiring and intimidating at the same time.\n\nThe man who created Apple.\n\nThe man who turned black turtlenecks into a uniform of power.\n\nThe man who changed technology forever.\n\nHis legacy is one-of-a-kind. The tech titan's impact on the world remains unparalleled.\n\nWhich is why it comes as no surprise that Jobs was a very unique individual right from the beginning.\n\nHe wasn’t your average kid. He was a born genius.\nHis biological parents, Abdul Fattah Jandali and Joanne Carole Schieble, unaware of the wonder they had created, gave him up for adoption almost immediately after he arrived.\n\nThey were both immigrants, unwed and too young to take responsibility of another human being.\n\nSoon, a working class couple, Paul and Clara Jobs, took in little Steve.\n\nFrom a very young age, Steve Jobs found himself mesmerised by the power and intricacy of computers.\n\nHe used to work with his mechanic father in the family garage, taking apart cars and putting them back together.This kick-started his love for machines. He credits his father for teaching him how to pay attention to detail, a mantra that sets Apple apart from most competitors. He was such a prodigy that his teachers suggested he skip several grades, a suggestion his parents rejected. At the age of 12, Jobs called HP founder Bill Hewlett to ask for electronic parts for a school project. This impressed Hewlett so much that he offered Jobs a summer internship.\n\nAs he grew up, Jobs developed a strong distaste for formal education. He never really enjoyed school. Eventually, he went to college but dropped out after the first semester. But he continued attending the classes that interested him. One of them was calligraphy. He later said of the course:\n\n\"If I had never dropped in on that single calligraphy course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.\" \n\nHe got a job at a video game manufacturing company, Atari. He saved up and headed to India with a friend for ‘spiritual enlightenment’. They stayed for 7 months, traveling around in buses between Delhi, UP and Himachal Pradesh. There, Jobs studied Eastern religion and returned home as a Buddhist. He had completely transformed as a person. He shaved his head and wore traditional Indian clothing.\n\nBut Jobs wasn’t done experimenting. He then turned to psychedelic drugs for further exploration of the mind. He described taking LSD as \"one of the two or three most important things\" he had done in his life.\n\nJobs led a very simple life after that. He practiced Zen Buddhism and lived in his parents’ backyard. Owing to his diversified experiences, the concept of counterculture became a driving force in his future ideologies. Then began a new phase in the great inventor’s life. Steve Jobs commenced a revolutionary collaboration with Steve Wozniak.\n The namesake duo went on to redefine computers and subsequently, the larger picture of technology. One day, they would be the co-founders of the world’s largest IT company.\n\nThey started with the ‘blue box’; a digital device that could be used to make long distance calls for free. Its success became their motivation to take on big companies with their inventions.\n\nThis led to the birth of the first-ever Apple machine.\nJobs and Wozniak paid for the ambitious project by selling off their gadgets. They laboured relentlessly in Jobs’ garage to finish it. Jobs spent the maximum time working and often greeted clients in his underwear, and barefoot. The man was still very much a hippie, just not when it came to business.\n\nHe chased investors till Intel agreed to fund them. Soon, Apple started making news and Jobs broke into Silicon Valley with a big bang. Jobs was worth $1 million when he was 23, $10 million at 24 and crossed $100 million by the time he was 25. He was the one of the youngest people to be featured on the Forbes list of the country’s richest people; a big feat without inheriting any family wealth.\n\nBut then mayhem made its way into Jobs’ life.\n\nHis on-and-off lover, Chrisann Brennan, became pregnant with his child. Jobs shunned responsibility and claimed he was sterile even though a DNA test proved he was the father. The matter became a legal controversy.\n\nA daughter was born and named Lisa. Surprisingly, Jobs named his new breakthrough personal computer Lisa as well. Time Magazine interviewed Jobs for its ‘Time Person Of The Year’ special but when the issue came out, it was revealed that instead of featuring Jobs, the magazine had named the computer the ‘Machine of the Year’. Jobs never trusted journalists again.\n\nThen came the biggest setback of Jobs’ career.\n\nAfter an internal discussion, he was fired from the Macintosh group. The decision was made after Pepsi Executive John Sculley encouraged the board to do so. Ironically, Jobs had recently hired Sculley.\n\nDespite the shocking betrayal, Jobs didn’t give up. He went on to establishing his new company, NeXT, but couldn’t boost sales due to the high prices of the machines.\n\nLater, NeXT would merge with Apple to give us the iOS we have today.\n\nBut Jobs wasn’t satisfied. He wanted to build a bigger empire. So, he invested in a startup called Graphics Group, now known as Pixar. He initially put in his millions and the company’s instant success after the release of Toy Story paid back Jobs and how. He remained a majority shareholder in Pixar. Everything was well. But suddenly, Jobs' life shattered completely. He was diagnosed with a rare form of pancreatic cancer.\n\nJobs famously declined any medical treatment and refused to see a doctor, turning instead to natural methods such as vegan diets, acupuncture and herbal juices to curb his illness. It is said that his plan backfired, worsening his health fatally.\n\nAfter a few years, when Jobs could no longer function normally, he resigned from Apple, writing:\n\n\"I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple's CEO, I would be the first to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come.\" He continued working at Apple and died six weeks after his final working day. He passed away calmly, surrounded by family. His last words were “Oh wow. Oh wow. Oh wow.”\n\nHe went into a coma right after that. The revolutionary visionary gave us quite the awe-inspiring legacy that will be taken into account by the future of technology around the world. Looking back at his incredible journey, all I can do is repeat Steve Jobs’ final words, “Oh wow.”"
    case elonmusk = "Visionary engineer and tech entrepreneur Elon Musk is best known as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of electric car manufacturer Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), and as the founder and CEO of aerospace manufacturer SpaceX. This article explores Musk’s journey towards achieving success as one of the world’s top businessmen.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nBorn and raised in Pretoria, South Africa, Musk exhibited an active entrepreneurial spirit from an early age. He received tremendous support from his engineer father and his dietitian mother, who recognized their son's penchant for technology and nurtured his passion.\n\nMusk bought his first computer at age 10 and taught himself how to write programming code. And at the tender age of 12, the youngster built a fully functioning video game called Blastar, which he reportedly sold for $500.\n\nAfter graduating from Pretoria Boys High School in 1988, Musk briefly attended the University of Pretoria for five months. He then moved to Canada, where he entered Queen's University in Ontario in 1889, enabling him to avoid South Africa's mandatory military service. Musk later attended the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned a bachelor's degree in economics. He was later accepted into the physics graduate program at Stanford University, but dropped out after two days, to pursue his entrepreneurial dreams.\n\n**Success Story**\n\nIn 1995, Musk teamed up with his brother Kimbal to create Zip2, an IT company that licensed online city guide software to newspapers. Although the company struggled to gain traction in its first few years, local and national newspapers eventually began using Zip2 to offer additional services to their respective customers. In 1999, Zip2 was acquired by Compaq’s AltaVista web search engine for a whopping $340 million.\n\nWith business partners Peter Thiel and Max Levchin, Musk then launched X.com, an online financial services and email payment company. In 2000, X.com merged with American software company Confinity, best known for creating PayPal. In 2001, Musk was named Paypal’s chairman and CEO, shortly before that company was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion. As a stockholder with roughly $180 million worth of shares, Musk finally had enough capital to leave internet businesses behind, and channel his energies towards engineering concerns.\n\n**Tesla and Beyond**\n\nIn 2004, Musk joined engineers Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, to help run Tesla Motors, where Musk was integral in designing the first electric car: the Tesla Roadster. After Eberhard was ousted from the firm in 2007, following a series of disagreements, Musk seized management control as CEO and product architect. Under his watch, Tesla has become one of the world's most popular and coveted car brands.\n\nWith his space travel company SpaceX, Musk landed several high-profile contracts with NASA and the United States Air Force, to design rockets and conduct military missions. Musk has been vocal about his plans to send an astronaut to Mars by the year 2025, in a collaborative effort with NASA.\n\n**Net Worth and Current Influence**\n\nThe majority of Musk's $20.8 billion net worth is tied up in Tesla stock, of which he owns more than 33 million shares. In January 2018, Tesla, which is valued at roughly $11.6 billion, announced a compensation structure where Musk will not receive an annual salary, but will instead earn cash based on the increasing market caps the company hopes to achieve over the next ten years. The deal aims to assure shareholders and customers alike, that Musk plans to remain embedded with the company over the long haul.\n\n**Influential Quotes**\n\n\"If something is important enough, you should try. Even if the probable outcome is failure.\"\n\n\"Failure is an option here. If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough.\"\n\n\"I would like to die on Mars, just not on impact.\"\n\n\"I think South Africa is a great country, but if you wanted to be close to the cutting edge, particularly in technology, you came to North America.\"\n\n"
    case jeffbezos = " Jeff Bezos the big picture comes to your eyes when your net worth is one hundred and fifty-two point nine billion dollars people pay attention to what you do that’s another day in the life for Jeff Bezos the founder of Amazon.\n\nAmazon is the largest retailer and the world’s largest company by market value Amazon with its six hundred and forty- seven thousand five hundred employees generate approximately two hundred and thirty-three billion dollars in revenue and if you think you get those figures by merely selling retail items think again.\n\nAmazon has 40 subsidiaries spanning across multiple industries such as gaming robotics clothing and food due to its involvement in multiple industries Amazon is standing off from Alibaba, Walmart, Microsoft, and Google just to name a few but how does Jeff Bezos made the such company, that question we need to look but before we need to know how it all began.\n\nThe beginning born in the 1960s Jeff Bezos from a young age always showed an interest in science and technology at one time creating an alarm system to keep his siblings out of his room during his high school. When his family moved to Florida, he was part of the University of Florida student science training program where he excelled to become the high school valedictorian Silver Knight Award Winner and National Merit Scholar all while working as the short-order line cook at McDonald’s the later moved on to Princeton University where he graduated with two degrees in electrical engineering and computer science right after Princeton University.\n\n**Related: Daily Habits of Entrepreneurs.**\n\nJeff Bezos found himself sought after by numerous firms from telecommunications startups to banks and by the age of 30 he was the Senior Vice –President for DE Shaw & Co a hedge fund company Jeff Bezos was in high demand but it wasn’t until the early 90s when Jeff Bezos Decided to start an online Book Store a year later he resigned from the hedge fund and founded amazon right out of his garage.\n\nHe said that he wrote his business plan for Amazon on a trip from New York to Seattle with approximately $300000 from his parent he committed himself to build Amazon inspired by the Amazon River he knew he wanted to be the largest company in the world he also knew he would have to expand into other products to grow, similar to the ways, the stream flowed into the larger Amazon River after three years in business Jeff Bezos took Amazon public raising approximately 54 million dollars and used it to begin his expansion he diversified into consumer goods and online music and video sales.\n\n**The Struggle:**\n\nStarting an online business during a time when hundreds of companies were learning the full potential of what the internet could do came with its own set of problems. Amazon had to survive through the dot-com bubble which it did due to its business structure. Amazon simply sold retail to consumers that paid with credit or debit cards which mean payments was instant there was no gap between paying its suppliers and receiving payments from customers a lot of other businesses suffered during that time and went out of business in the early the 2000s at the peak of the dot-com bubble sales slopped, it affected Amazon’s revenue causing them to lay off workers almost go bankrupt.\n\nHowever with a loan from banks by the following year, Amazon recovered and it was back to generating profits what also made it difficult in the beginning was the fact that Amazon did not own any of the books they sold or had inventory after an order was made Jeff Bezos would search for the item from old bookstores himself before shipping it.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n\"GO BIG AND GO FAST\" was Jeff Bezos mindset from the onset of taking his company public in the late 90’s Jeff Bezos began acquiring smaller competitors and diversifying the business to appeal to a wider demographic. He soon launched his first subsidiary and product Amazon Web Services (AWS) compiled data from weather channels and website traffic then he launched the Amazon Kindle which transformed the way we read books.\n\nThe Kindle gave us the ability to have digital versions of our favorite novels, however through every step, they were common threads throughout all that Jeff Bezos did  he did not focus on competitors or the technology he focused on what consumers wanted which was basically a wide selection of items at low prices that they could receive quickly when ordered their consumer desires that Jeff Bezos believes would never change so instead of trying to engage his competitors his goal was to always stay ahead of their customers.\n\n**Also Read: Jack Ma Success Story.**\n\nIf your competitor focused you always have to wait until there’s competitor doing something being customer-focused allows you to be more pioneering.\n\n==  The Defining Moment: ==\n\nThe first book that sold saw the launch of the online retail giant the defining moment came years later when they launched Amazon Web Service, it was the service that allowed people and the company to see the potential of the internet its the earliest version was free and helped businesses develop applications that would allow them to incorporate Amazon’s service into their websites now of the world could not only shop on their websites but sell their products using Amazon as well this transformed not only online retail but also the IT industry in the name of cloud computing and positioned them as a leader.\n\n== The Value: ==\n\nBefore the launch of Amazon everyone shopped at brick-and-mortar stores, so if we were to narrow down all to one thing that Amazon provides for its customers its convenience hence the reason why Amazon focuses on satisfying their customers over worrying about competitors Amazon Achieves this by providing a continuously growing selection of products combined with personalized experience and by keeping up with fast service not just in delivery but in response on their websites Amazon saw that even a 0.1-second delay causes a loss of Billion Dollar drop-in activity on they're site so they have been optimizing their website to prevent such delays.\n\nAmazon has kept to one of its pillars of keeping prices competitive Jeff Bezos has done numerous things to keep expenses low within the company so he can pass those savings on to customers from restricting salaries to keeping old Black & White printers to nobody in the company flying first-class frugality is one of Amazon’s official company values in the mindset of traditional retailers announcing closures Amazon has continuously seen growth over the past five years and with the growth of their prime one and two-day delivery services. They’re picking up customers that other retailers are losing in fact because of that service other online retailers are trying to do the same proving that Amazon has been correct in focusing on providing for their customers while the competition has been trying to catch up that.\n\n== Controversy: ==\n\nFrom inception despite pioneering the online retail industry Amazon has attracted its fair share of controversy three years ago Apple filed a case against one of Amazon’s third-party sellers Mobile Star LLC for selling fake Apple products. Apple purchased and identified 90% of the counterfeit items for themselves apparently Amazon wasn’t confirming the source of the items as genuine Mobile Star LLC settled with Apple for an undisclosed amount a coalition of civil rights groups opposed agreements by Amazon to supply facial recognition support and consultancy services to law enforcement especially as Amazon has publicly spoken against any secret surveillance being carried out by the company.\n\nAmazon had offered to connect Washington Country with its government customers the civil rights group sees it as a service that can be abused in identifying and tracking anyone and most recently they ‘ve been in discussions with the National Labor Relations Board for implementing a system that track workers productivity and can fire them for failing to meet production targets. Even though Amazon states there are human supervisors that can override. The system and those that don’t beat their targets are provided extra training it does not ease the mind of workers who are now concerned for their jobs and don’t even stop to use the bathroom.\n\n== The Result: ==\n\nJeff Bezos steered Amazon into the position it holds today by listening by being innovative by optimizing and by delivering. They continuously improve their processes so it could be more efficient for their customers what’s dangerous is not to evolve Jeff Bezos.\n\nAmazon does not just sell to customers either they sell them things they didn’t even realize they wanted by observing customers purchase history they’ve implemented customer reviews which present items to the customer based on their past purchase searches and trends added to that when Amazon introduced the button. They increased the ease and convenience of shopping online for items you noticed you were running low on push the- button on the website and within seconds they confirm your order via email or text and it’s immediately shipped to you.\n\nOver the past 15 years, Amazon has offered a wider product range through a marketplace recently Amazon gained one million twenty-nine thousands five hundred and twenty-eight new sellers whose product sales totaled approximately one hundred nineteen billion dollars.\n\n== The Future: ==\n\nAmazon is now a lot more than your average one-stop online shop it’s been a leader in cloud services and also artificial intelligence with its echo device and Alexa AI assistant Amazon continues to grow by acquiring more companies just 2 years ago they acquired  ten startups including Harvest AL, Game Sparks, Blink and Souq which shows they are heading to develop more in AI. Focusing on virtual assistants voice processing and AI as a service and with its innovation in cloud computing Amazon can position itself as a platform company its largest acquisition has been that of Whole Foods for 13.7 billion dollars all part of their plan to increase its market share in physical retail spaces. \n\nThey’ve already opened physical bookstores and launched a cashier-less convenience store Amazon Go currently there are 10 locations and we can definitely expect to begin to see more opening up nationwide so, what exactly does Jeff Bezos look for when acquiring a company a dreamy business the offering has at least four characteristics:\n\nCustomers love it can grow to a very large size it has strong returns on capital and it’s durable in time with the potential to endure for decades.\n\nBezos says, when you find one of those you don’t just swipe right you get married for the last three years Amazon has  been working on improving customer service through their air drone delivery Amazon Air the first service launched in England but now Amazon also has their eyes set on disrupting the shipping industry.\n\n They’ve been building a fleet of 50 Boeing 767s and increase their Airport Hub operations they’re currently building a hub at Cincinnati Northern Kentucky International Airport will help keep billions of dollars of business in house and away from FedEx, UPS and USP'S.\n\n== Closing: ==\n\nFrom humble beginnings starting in a garage selling one book at a time amazon has grown into an unstoppable conglomerate across multiple industries such as retail logistics customers technology, cloud computing and most recently media and the entertainment their founder and leader Jeff Bezos is known for his transformational and leadership style showcases  his charisma and power to things that were needed to build the largest store in the world.\n\n There was a shift among the top companies in the world in the month of June as of June 11th Amazon blew past Apple to  become the most valuable global brand valued at 315.5 billion dollars what does this do to Jeff Bezos his net worth is increased from 132 billion to 155 billion."
